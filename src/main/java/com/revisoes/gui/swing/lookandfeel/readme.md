# Lesson: Modifying the Look and Feel

[Exemplos tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/examples/lookandfeel/index.html)

This lesson tells you how to change the look and feel of your Swing application. The "look" of an application refers to its appearance. The "feel" refers to how the widgets behave. You can choose to use the default Swing look and feel (such as the Ocean theme for the Metal look and feel), or the look and feel of the native platform (such as Windows, GTK+), or you can customize your own look and feel.
