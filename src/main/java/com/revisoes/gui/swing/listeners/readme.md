<p>
This lesson gives you details about writing event listeners. You might not need to read this section. Your first source of information for event should be the how-to section for the component in question. Each component's section shows code for handling the events most commonly needed when implementing the component. For example, How to Use Check Boxes shows you how to handle mouse clicks on check boxes using an item listener.
